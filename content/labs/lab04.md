## Submission Instructions

At the due date (listed at the top), the CSE systems will automatically submit whatever code is sitting in your master branch of each exercise. Before the due time, please ensure that what you see in gitlab is what you want to submit. No steps are required to "submit" each week's lab other than ensuring your master branch is up to date.

## Marking

When marking your programming lab exercises, the following aspects are considered:
* exercise is submitted on time;
* code passes pipeline with provided pytests / your pytests;
* code passes markerâ€™s autotests;
* code solves the problem and is not a hardcoded solution;
* code is written cleanly and pythonically;
* any tests you write are comprehensive and cover a wide range of possible cases;
* where specified, tests give 100% branch code coverage; and
* any other requirements outlined in the problem specification.

When marking your written lab exercises, the following aspects are considered:
* answers are comprehensive and thoughtful;
* answers address all aspects of the question; and
* answers in correct format as specified by the question.
