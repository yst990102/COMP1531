From dawn to dusk, people drive down my street
To work and to money, the means to thrive
Never smiling, ever silent, working only to eat
And again and again until the end of their lives

When they go home, they see their great loves
But there is nothing behind their smiles
For at the end lies tears and shoves
And the children all turn out vile

They go down my street, never smiling, never frowning
To work and to home, sheep in a field
The Shepard hovers over their heads like a fog
And then their days end, them none the wiser

Why do you continue with your shallow existence?
You fear to deviate, to show resistance
