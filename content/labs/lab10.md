# Lab 10

### Due: Week 11, Monday 10:00 am AEST

### Value: 2% of Course Mark 

### Aim

Complete a series of auto-marked python tasks. Because there is no ability to mark your week 10 lab off in week 11 (like a normal week), we instead are providing you with a number of practice exercises that we will automark. These exercises will assist you in preparing for your exam.

## Exercises

 * [Lab10](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1531/redirect/?path=COMP1531/21T1/students/_/lab10)

## Submission Instructions

At the due date (listed at the top), the CSE systems will automatically submit whatever code is sitting in your master branch of each exercise. Before the due time, please ensure that what you see in gitlab is what you want to submit. No steps are required to "submit" each week's lab other than ensuring your master branch is up to date.
