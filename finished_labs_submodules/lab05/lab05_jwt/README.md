## Lab05 - Exercise - JWT (1 point)

This exercise should be be worked on individually.

Observe the following jwt

```jwt
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1X2lkIjoiMTIzNDUifQ.lBTAPFU1xxDAi2Vrusfo67ypBai0vBr6O7KOt6CJf1s
```

### Part 1
What data is stored in this JWT? Write it down inside `jwt.md`

### Part 2
This payload was originally encoded with a secret of "comp1531". Is the JWT above appropriately signed with this secret, or has it been tampered? Justify your answer in `jwt.md`.

You can either write a program to decode the jwt similar to how you dealt with token in your program, or you can use [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to do the conversion.
