# Lab 03

### Due: Week 4, Monday (8th March) 10:00 am AEDT

### Value: 2% of Course Mark (7 points gives full marks)

### Aim

* Further practice programming in python
* Further practise using pytest
* Working with objects in python

## Overview

You may find the following information useful for this lab:

* You can use the command `pytest` to run pytest. It will automatically find your tests and run them.
* Dictionaries can be indexed with `[` and `]`. For example, `a['b']`.
* Dictionaries have a `get()` method you may find useful. The documentation for it is [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get).
* Remember to revise `if __name__ == '__main__'` pattern to allow your code to run as intended
* Spend a moment looking at the `datetime` module in python, it will be helpful.

## Submission Instructions

At the due date (listed at the top), the CSE systems will automatically submit whatever code is sitting in your master branch of each exercise. Before the due time, please ensure that what you see in gitlab is what you want to submit. No steps are required to "submit" each week's lab other than ensuring your master branch is up to date.

## Marking

When marking your programming lab exercises, the following aspects are considered:
* exercise is submitted on time;
* code passes pipeline with provided pytests / your pytests;
* code passes markerâ€™s autotests;
* code solves the problem and is not a hardcoded solution;
* code is written cleanly and pythonically;
* any tests you write are comprehensive and cover a wide range of possible cases;
* where specified, tests give 100% branch code coverage; and
* any other requirements outlined in the problem specification.
