## Lab05 - Exercise - Team (1 point)

By yourself, answer the following questions:

1. What do you expect will end up being the biggest challenges of working in a team by the end of the term?
    i think the biggest challenges are balance everyone's work and code communication.
    Because the proportion of each part of the project is different, work in balance is very important, which need us to take a careful consideration.
    And cause members in our group write tests for other members' implementation function, good communication and comment are also a big challenge.

2. Now that we're half way through, what is one aspect of teamwork that you're hoping to learn more about?
    i hope to learn more about the teamwork note taking and summarization.
