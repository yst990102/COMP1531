As a university student, I want to set due dates of to-do items so that I can complete tasks on time.

stories:
1. People may have girlfriends or boyfriends, family members, or maybe other relationships. So maybe set people in the contect list with multiple relations.
2. Notification is a good idea, but sometimes people may not want to receive notification when they are at meeting or driving.
3. Channel and dm are really good. But, if we have many channels and many dms, is there any way to Tag them and make classification?
4. i want to send message with vivid emojis. Emojis are so cute and cool.
5. i want to tag myself. birth date, hobbies, favourite food and such things like that.

To_do list:
1. set contact book for each users, and classify people by contact category.
2. set status for each people, and let them change their own status.
3. set channel_tags and dm_tags, help people to classify and sort out their channels and dms.
4. set personal emoji list. let peoplr have rights to add their favourite emoji.
5. set more info in the user profile. birth date, hobbies, etc.
