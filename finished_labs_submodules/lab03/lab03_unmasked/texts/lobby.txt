There was no sound but for the double automatic doors which slid open at his presence. After he entered, and the squeak of his finely polished shoes on the black marble faded away, silence fell again. The room he was in gave off a feel of being frozen, and even as he looked down at the white reflective floor beneath him, he saw his ghostly pale reflection looking back up at him, silent as ever. Looking up again, his eyes were slightly dazzled by the light emanating around the room, bouncing off the pale walls and into the back of his eyes. Yet, he realised, the light all seemed to be artificial, not a drop of sunlight entered the room. A cold, menacing light which slowly worked to blind his eyes.

The desk in front of him was probably the coldest feature in the room, mainly for the fact that the place behind it was deserted. Nothing but a small flower in a pot sat on it, as if to make up for the lack of a receptionist to warmly greet him. As he stared at the wall behind the desk, his head began to throb painfully. He looked up and down the length of the room. Nothing met his eyes but the cold, hard light, and the occasional speck of a darker colour was lost in the midst of it all. It was not until he was holding his head in pain that he saw the writing, but the letters were indescribable, a faint blur on an icy backdrop. Turning around to leave, he found that the doors would not open from the inside. So he stepped forward into the lobby.

The only sound was the thud of his body hitting the floor.
