# Lab 01

### Due: Week 2, Monday (22nd February), 10:00 am AEDT

### Value: 2% of Course Mark (5 points gives full marks)

### Aim

* Become familiar with course practices for labs
* Learn how to use GitLab effectively
* Learn how to create and run a Python program via the command-line.
* Introduce simple Python exercises based on topics covered in week 1

## Overview

For this and all future labs you *must* submit your lab work by the deadline in order to get marked. Each lab is worth 2 marks. For this and many of the future labs, you will need to show your work to your tutor or assistant tutor in either the lab in which it is done or the subsequent lab. They will provide you feedback and give you your marks.

## Exercises

 * [Git Basics](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1531/redirect/?path=COMP1531/21T1/students/_/lab01_git-basics) (1 point)
 * [Python - Hello program](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1531/redirect/?path=COMP1531/21T1/students/_/lab01_python-hello) (1 point)
 * [Python - Integers program](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1531/redirect/?path=COMP1531/21T1/students/_/lab01_python-integers) (1 point)
 * [Python - Names](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1531/redirect/?path=COMP1531/21T1/students/_/lab01_names) (1 point)
 * [Python - Strings program](https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1531/redirect/?path=COMP1531/21T1/students/_/lab01_python-strings) (1 point)


## Submission Instructions

At the due date (listed at the top), the CSE systems will automatically submit whatever code is sitting in your master branch of each exercise. Before the due time, please ensure that what you see in gitlab is what you want to submit. No steps are required to "submit" each week's lab other than ensuring your master branch is up to date.

## Marking

When marking your programming lab exercises, the following aspects are considered:
* exercise is submitted on time;
* code passes pipeline with provided pytests / your pytests;
* code passes markerâ€™s autotests;
* code solves the problem and is not a hardcoded solution;
* code is written cleanly and pythonically;
* any tests you write are comprehensive and cover a wide range of possible cases;
* where specified, tests give 100% branch code coverage; and
* any other requirements outlined in the problem specification.

When marking your written lab exercises, the following aspects are considered:
* answers are comprehensive and thoughtful;
* answers address all aspects of the question; and
* answers in correct format as specified by the question.
